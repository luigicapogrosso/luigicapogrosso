## Hi there, I am Luigi 👋

🖥️ I earned my [Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence](https://www.phd-ai.it/en/359-2/) at the [Polytechnic of Turin](https://www.polito.it/index.php?lang=en) in collaboration with the University of Verona 
under the supervision of Prof. [Marco Cristani](https://www.dimi.univr.it/?ent=persona&id=218&lang=en) and Prof. [Franco Fummi](https://www.dimi.univr.it/?ent=persona&id=59&lang=en).

🎓 I received my B.Sc. (2019) and M.Sc. (2021) at the [University of Verona](https://www.univr.it/en/home) in Computer Science and Computer Engineering for Robotics and Smart Industry, respectively.

📌 I had the privilege of being a visiting scholar at the [Istituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en), working with Prof. [Mário A. T. Figueiredo](http://www.lx.it.pt/~mtf/).

📚 My research interests cover the broad area of deep learning, and the main topics I am currently working on can be grouped into the classes of deep learning-enabled cyber-physical systems and representation learning.
