## Hi there, I am Luigi 👋

🖥️ I am a Ph.D. candidate of the National Program in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Verona in collaboration with the Polytechnic of Turin in the IntelliGO labs under the supervision of Prof. Marco Cristani and Prof. Franco Fummi.

🎓 I received my B.Sc. (2019) and M.Sc. (2021) at the University of Verona in Computer Science and Computer Engineering for Robotics and Smart Industry, respectively.

📌 I had the privilege of being a visiting scholar at the Pattern Recognition and Automatic Learning Lab at Istituto Superior Técnico, headed by Prof. Mário A. T. Figueiredo.

📚 My research interests cover the broad area of deep learning, and the main topics I am currently working on can be grouped into the classes of efficient deep learning and representation learning.
